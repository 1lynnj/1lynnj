I'm a former veterinary professional who recently made a career change to software development.

Working in high-volume specialty veterinary emergency and surgery practices, I learned the value of working cooperatively within a team and the necessity for creative problem solving when the cases didn't follow the rules. I discovered my love of tech when researching and implementing solutions to reduce face-to-face interactions in a healthcare field during the pandemic.

I'm a graduate of [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org) where I learned full stack web development including Python, Flask, RESTful API, SQL, SQLAlchemy, HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. I added Django to my tech stack with my final Capstone project at Ada.

As part of the Ada program, I completed a 5-month internship at [Rebellion Defense](https://rebelliondefense.com) that converted to a full-time engineering role upon completion. For 16 months, I collaborated with talented engineers who generously shared their time and knowledge. This experience has been invaluable, and I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned in a new role.
