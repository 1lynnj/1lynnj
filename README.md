Hello! I'm a 20-year veterinary professional making a career change to software development.

Working in high-volume specialty veterinary emergency and surgery practices, I learned the value of working cooperatively within a team and the necessity for creative problem solving when the cases didn't follow the rules. I discovered my love of tech when researching and implementing solutions to reduce face-to-face interactions in a healthcare field during the pandemic.

I completed the classroom portion of the Ada Developers Academy bootcamp where I learned full stack web development including Python, Flask, RESTful API, SQL, SQLAlchemy, HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. I added Django to my tech stack with my final capstone project at Ada.

Currently, I'm in the 2nd phase of Ada's program working towards completing a 5-month full stack SWE internship with Rebellion Defense where I'm honing my skills as a full stack engineer and learning new tech and tools including AWS, Artifactory, Docker and Jira using the agile scrum methodology.
